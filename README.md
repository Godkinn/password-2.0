# password-2.0
As we do more on the internet we also need more protection. Passwords are not strong enough anymore, and can easily be brute-forced, meaning that a software just tries out every possible password until it gets the right one. Although people have come up with solutions, they are not always good, and often slow down logging in. This problem can be fixed with a better kind of password. Password-2.0 will make it impossible to brute-force a password. 

It will do this by separating the password into 'blocks'. Each block contains 3 ASCII characters, and a password consists out of 2 blocks. This means that a password consists out of 6 characters, which is half of the characters advised for a normal password. If you type in the right characters in the first block, you proceed to the next one, and if you do the same there, you are done. The trick is when you do it wrong. If you fill in the wrong password, you will have to go through another block, meaning the total password is 9 characters. Do it wrong again, and you are facing a 12 character password. If a computer tries to brute-force the password it will not succeed, because for every wrong try it will have to face a block more.
